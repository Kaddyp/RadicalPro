Login / Authentication in Laravel
=================================

In Laravel, we can login using 2 ways :

1) By Installing Built-in Packages (no code) :
>> Register, Login, Dashboard, Logout (we get all ready made pages)
>> Always install in a fresh laravel application

--> Breeze Package (fast, light weight)

Breeze uses Tailwind CSS by default.


2) Using Code

Routes, Views, Logic for Login
